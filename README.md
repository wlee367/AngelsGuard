# AngelsGuard
It helps provide safety at public events and gatherings by connecting to you to an "angel" (security personnel), in case you are in trouble at a public event. 

## Description
This web app that allows clients/participants to sign up and have a discrete way to call for help in case of an emergency. Hosts create an event, where users go to. One user can make a profile, and sign up for the event for the night. This connects the user with the app, where if they press the "I'm in Danger" button, the web app notifies the security guards via text message.

In a perfect world, this is a discrete way to facilitate responses from the security guards to prevent emergencies.

In the future, we would like to implement a feature for the security guards. This feature would allow security guards to text the Twilio number back, and this would send the message through the server and to the web app and the user would have more options to text back.

## Languages/Frameworks used
1. Node.Js (do we really need to say more?)
2. Twilio API 
3. HTML
4. CSS
5. Javascript
6. MongoDB 
7. Facebook Login API()

## Future Plans for AngelsGuard
1. Implement Facial Recognition and GPS Tracking to help locate guests
2. Add a feature in which if an angel in the event location or the closest angel cannot be contacted, the police will be notified to arrive
3. Textback/call back feature for security guards in applicable situations.
